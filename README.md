# MMM-SingleStock

This is a module for the [MagicMirror²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/) to display a single stock price without any fancy animation.

## Features

By default this module displays the symbol and the current price of the configured stock:

![Default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balassy/MMM-SingleStock/master/doc/screenshot-default.png)

You can configure the module to display the full name of the company instead of the stock symbol:

![With full company name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balassy/MMM-SingleStock/master/doc/screenshot-companyname.png)

If you wish, you can completely remove the prefix, and display only the price value:

![Without prefix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balassy/MMM-SingleStock/master/doc/screenshot-none.png)

You can even configure any custom prefix, for example a dollar sign:

![With custom prefix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balassy/MMM-SingleStock/master/doc/screenshot-customprefix.png)

The second line of the module displays the change of the price which can be hidden if you prefer:

![Without second line](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balassy/MMM-SingleStock/master/doc/screenshot-nochange.png)

You can also configure the module to display a percent change in the price:

![Percent Change](doc/screenshot-percentchange.png)

Finally, this module also supports a smaller view as well as colorizing the percentage change and highlight the stock value:

![Minimal](doc/screenshot-minimizedcolorized.png)

This module is capable to display only a single stock price. If you would like to see the price of more stocks on your mirror, add this module multiple times.

For updates, please check the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/balassy/MMM-SingleStock/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Using the module

To use this module follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to the `modules` folder of your MagicMirror:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/balassy/MMM-SingleStock.git
```

2. Add the following configuration block to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:

```js
var config = {
  modules: [

      module: 'MMM-SingleStock',
      position: 'top_right',
      config: {
        stockSymbol: 'GOOG',
        apiToken: 'YOUR_TOKEN',  // Unique, private API key obtained from https://iexcloud.io/console/tokens
        updateInterval: 3600000, // 1 hour in milliseconds
        showChange: true,        // false | true
        changeType: '',          // 'percent' | ''
        colorized: false,        // false | true to show percent in green/red as well as highlight stock symbol
        minimal: true,           // false | true to reduce the font size for a more compact display
        label: 'symbol'          // 'symbol' | 'companyName' | 'none' | any string
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## How it works

This module periodically sends requests from the browser window of the MagicMirror Electron application to the [IEX Cloud Service](https://iextrading.com/developer/). The IEX Cloud API has [multiple tiers](https://iexcloud.io/pricing/) including a free tier which is suitable for this module. However to access the API you need a unique, private API Token.

You can sign up to IEX Cloud by visiting this URL: https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/

## Localization

Currently this module supports English (`en`) and Hungarian (`hu`) languages. The language can be specified in the global `language` setting in the `config.js` file.
